WebSocket endpoint — real-time push from backend to all connected browser clients.

Clients connect once and receive:
  - earthquake_detected  → event was ingested from USGS
  - simulation_running   → worker picked up the event
  - simulation_complete  → full simulation result (triggers map update)
  - simulation_error     → something went wrong
  - ping                 → keep-alive heartbeat every 25s
